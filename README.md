# Batch Processing

## Description

This project is part of the Operating Systems class, where batch processing concepts are put into practice. The project involves modifying the content of text files. The project fulfills the following requested requirements:

1. Accept a folder location as input.
2. Create a copy of the same folder.
3. In the copy, locate all files in both the main folder and its subfolders.
4. Change the content of all found files as follows:
   - Replace all letters with a random digit from 0 to 9.
   - Replace all digits with a random uppercase letter from A to Z.

This project demonstrates your ability to manipulate files and folders using Java.
